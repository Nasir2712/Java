# JAVA

BookStore Application - This is a simple book store application that i made for my class project using JavaFX. A user can add, remove, search books and view them in a list as well.

Student App - An student course registration application that allows a student to register for a course, calculate how many credits a student has taken and calculates GPA for every student's course.

User Information System - This application is a custom login system that allows a user admin to add in, search and remove users.

Learning Java was so interesting. I have posted all the projects that i've worked on in my class.
